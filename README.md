# Pento Machine Learning Engineer Challenge

### Hi! I'm Juan Tabarez and welcome to my solution of the Pento's Machine Learning Engineer Challenge!

First of all, I want to thank for this oportunity.

As you will see I choose using a Jupyter Notebook so I can make explainations during the process. For the same reason I skipped adding a documentation file, as I understand that the nootebook is clear enough.

At the bottom of the solution I left prepared a code where you can easily evaluate the model by only entering the path of a new image.

I hope you liked my solution and I look foward to your response.
