# Pento Machine Learning Engineer Challenge

### Hi! I'm Juan Tabarez, and welcome to my solution for Pento's Machine Learning Engineer Challenge.

First, I want to thank you for this opportunity.

For this solution, I used a Jupyter Notebook to implement and explain my approach step by step. Given that the notebook contains detailed explanations, I chose to omit a separate documentation file, as I believe the notebook is self-explanatory.

At the bottom of the notebook, Iâ€™ve included a code block that allows you to evaluate the model easily by providing the path to a new image. I used this block to verify the model's performance with the images from the test folder, which I had taken from the internet, and they were correctly classified by the model.

Regarding the "other" class, the model will predict one of the four trained classes when presented with a new image. It will not throw an error if the image doesn't belong to one of these classes, though it will classify the image as the closest matching class.

Thank you for reviewing my solution, and I look forward to your response!
